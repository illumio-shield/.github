# Illumio Community Contribution Guidelines  

Contributing new content or modifying existing content allows Illumio users and enthusiasts to share their work with the community. Note that all Community content is NOT supported under Illumio Support SLAs, and users seeking support should submit a GitHub issue. Questions can also be posted on the Illumio Community Forum. Contact information may also be provided by the project authors.  
 
## How to Contribute

Create a fork of the relevant repository and follow any specific contributing guidelines defined. A member of the Illumio Maintainers team will review any submitted pull requests.  

Make sure to include a description of your contribution, what it fixes or adds to the project, along with some example code if relevant to the submission. Specify the compatible versions of the Illumio and partner platforms the submission was validated against.    
 
The project maintainers will review the pull request, and may ask questions or request changes. Any submission will need to pass project-specific checks and GitHub static analysis/secret detection. If there are no issues, the code will be merged and published in the next release.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * The project maintainers will do their best to respond promptly, but Community projects do not provide a guarantee of support.
> * Illumio reserves the right to remove or reject any Community content without notice.
